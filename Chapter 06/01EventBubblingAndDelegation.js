// What is Event Bubbling? Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model).
//  It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles 
//  up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor 
// elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element


// Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events.
// Events can be added to a parent element instead of adding to every single element.
// It refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events 
// at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.
